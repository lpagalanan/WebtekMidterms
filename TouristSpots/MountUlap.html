		<p> A “mini-Mt. Ugo” which showcases the best of what the Cordilleras has to offer: Pine and grassland ridges with stunning views of the mountains,
		 and even a glimpse of culture with villages, burial caves, and hanging bridges, the Mt. Ulap Eco-Trail in Itogon, Benguet is the perfect dayhike 
		 from Baguio City. Spanning around 8 kilometres through several peaks along the Ampucao-Sta. Fe Ridge it is easy enough to be completed from 4-6 
		 hours, making it feasible as a dayhike or even a half-dayhike for hikers of all levels.
