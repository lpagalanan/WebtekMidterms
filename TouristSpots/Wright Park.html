<h1>Wright Park</h1>
</header>

<p>Wright Park, which is located at the eastern part of the city and fronting the main gate of the Mansion, is one of the many scenic parks in Baguio City. 
Its main features are a shallow elongated rectangular body of water known as the "Pool of Pines" and the park circle which is on one end of the park. 
Postcard-type photographs are usually taken at both ends of Wright Park and when going there it is best to bring along a camera.
Tall pine trees and decorative street lights line both sides of the access road beside the pool. There are times that you will find at the park some 
Igorots dressed in their native attire and regalia who are willing to pose for a photograph ... of course, for a fee. Native handicrafts are also sold at the 
Mansion end of the park by a few Igorot peddlers. From the park circle is a walkway which leads to a wide stairway made of stones that descend to an area 
where ponies are rented out.
