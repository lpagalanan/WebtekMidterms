		<p> There is no doubt that the Mines View Park is one of the most popular and most visited park in the 		   city. From the observation deck of the park a breathtaking panoramic view of Benguet's gold and copper 		           mines and the surrounding mountains unfolds before you. It is a spectacular sight to behold and should                     not be missed when visiting Baguio.
