<h1>Lions Head</h1>
</header>

<p>Along Kennon Road is the undisputed landmark in Baguio where you can take souvenir photograph with the famous lion head which serves
 as the backdrop. The 40-foot high lion head, carved by a Cordillera artist from a limestone boulder,
 is a symbol that would proclaim the presence of the Lion Club group in this mountain resort city. Beside the lion head are
 a few small stalls that sell woodcarving and other native handicraft.
