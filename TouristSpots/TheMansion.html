		<p> The Mansion consists of an elegantly-designed Spanish Colonial Revival main building and a guest house. The elaborate main gate, made of ornate 
		   ironwork, was earlier reported as a replica of one of the main gates at Buckingham Palace in London, which is false. The front gate is still one
                   of the most photographed section of the property. Tourists can visit the Mansion's museum containing presidential memorabilia. Across the road 
		   from the Mansion House is Wright Park, a quiet promenade with a long reflecting pool lined with pine trees. A long stairway leads visitors to the 
		   back where ponies for children are available for hire. Dotted all around the nearby hills are vacation homes and small inns.
