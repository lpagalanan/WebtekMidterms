 You do get a chance to climb up the wooden ladder and see what is inside each hut.There are a few native handicraft items that are sold aside 
from some books and publications about the Igorot people, their culture and traditions. You can also order a hot cup of native coffee which gets 
to be a welcome treat after completing a tour of the entire village, especially on a cold and rainy day.
