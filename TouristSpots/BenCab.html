		<p> The Bencab Museum houses the permanent collection of Philippine National Artist Benedicto Cabrera (BenCab) in several galleries, as well as 
		venues for art shows and exhibitions.  The museum houses the artist’s collections of his own works, as well as those of acknowledged Filipino 
		masters and rising contemporary artists. The granary gods, lime containers, native implements, weapons and other outstanding examples of indigenous 
		arts and crafts of the Cordilleras are also highlighted. The museum commands a breathtaking view of the adjacent garden, farm, hill and mini-forest, 
		the surrounding mountains, and the South China sea in the distant west.
