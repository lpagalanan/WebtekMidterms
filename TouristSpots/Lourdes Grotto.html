</header>
The Lourdes Grotto is another Catholic shrine and place of meditation in Baguio. It is located on a high hill in the western part of the city 
where you will find the image of the Lady of Lourdes. Access to the top of the grotto could be made by climbing the 252 steps or by driving a 
light vehicle through a winding, narrow and steep asphalt-paved road. Devotees, who go up to the grotto to pray, usually light up a candle at an altar below the image.
