<h1>Panagbenga Park</h1>
</header>
Panagbenga Park is a relatively small park with lush greens, flowering plants and playful butterflies. 
Being relatively small the park does not offer much as compared to Baguio City’s Burnham Park,
 there are no attractions except for flowers, butterflies and trees. This place is ideal for shutterbugs as there are a lot of plants
 that could be a good subject for macro photography.
