		<p> Also known as the Igorot Village, the Botanical Garden features native huts typical of the type of Igorot dwellings found in the Cordilleras. 
		    The village is said to capture the ethnic spirit and cultural legacy of the Igorots and being tranquil and quiet, it is a nice place to just 
                    sit down and relax, take a leisurely stroll along its narrow and winding pathways and also enjoy the landscape where you will find numerous 
  		    plants and trees.Some years back Igorot dances and rituals were held in an improvised outdoor stage within the village. Local students go to 
		    the Botanical Garden for a day of retreat or just enjoy the outdoor environment. When visiting the Botanical Garden, you will usually find a 
		    group of Igorots at the main entrance who are dressed in their authentic native attire and regalia. They will be more than happy to pose with 
		    visitors for a souvenir picture.
